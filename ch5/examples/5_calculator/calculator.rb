# Lets create a simple calculator app together, it should have a get method for localhost:4567/calculator that displays two forms
# the first form should post (note that post is one of those http methods) to localhost:4567/add, and have two fields named "num1" and "num2"
# the second form should post to localhost:4567/add1 with the same args
# the page that they go to should display the result, and have a button to get back to calculator
