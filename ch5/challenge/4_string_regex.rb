# Given a string, return a string where every appearance of the lowercase word "is" has been replaced with "is not". 
# The word "is" should not be immediately preceeded or followed by a letter -- so for example the "is" in "this" does not count. 
# 
# not_replace("is test")         # => "is not test"
# not_replace("is-is")           # => "is not-is not"
# not_replace("This is right")   # => "This is not right"
