# Given a string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -- 
# so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" count, but not the 'y' in "yellow" (not case sensitive). 
# We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it. 
#
# 
# count_YZ("fez day")    # => 2
# count_YZ("day fez")    # => 2
# count_YZ("day fyyyz")  # => 2
