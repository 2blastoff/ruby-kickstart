# take the calculator problem and add the functionality to multiply, divide, and mod
#
# *DO THIS IN THE EXAMPLES DIRECTORY FROM BEFORE*
# $ pwd

#
# When you are satisfied that it works, stage all of your work with 
# $ git add -A
#
# Add them to your repo with
# $ git commit -m "my calculator works!"
#
# Push them to heroku with
# git push heroku mater
#
# Go check out your app with
# heroku open


# Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to try and find a way to test that your app works correctly
# you'll have to do that yourself. I'll look into my options over the next week, though, and hopefully
# the challenges further forward will have test suites behind them.
