*CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE, PLACING ON GITHUB SO I CAN COLLABORATE WITH A FRIEND*

h2. Told a friend I could teach her everything she learned in her Java class... in Ruby, in a week.

Initially, I was going to try to follow the Java book: *Absolute Java* by Walter Savitch
(I have the 3rd edition, b/c I took it a few years ago -- btw, this is a fantastic book if you are new to programming, I gave it 10 stars on Amazon)

However, I found that it was causing me to get caught up in details that I feel will become obvious with use. So, instead, I am going to write this based off notes I took while I was learning Ruby.
