# Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. 
# If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. 
# 
# Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with n.to_s and then check the length of the string.)
# 
# sum_limit(2, 3) # =>  5
# sum_limit(8, 3) # =>  8
# sum_limit(8, 1) # =>  9
