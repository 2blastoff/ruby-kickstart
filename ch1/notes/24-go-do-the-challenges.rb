# Okay, we made it through :)
# Now you just need to go do the challenges
# 
# Open up the challenges in your text editor. Try to complete the first one.
# Then go to the terminal, and navigate to the directory with the Rakefile in it.
# Then run $ rake 1:1
# 
# Did you pass? No? 
# Okay, look at the output and try again. See what went wrong? 
# Try again!
# 
# Did you pass? Yeah? 
# Great! No go finish the rest :D
