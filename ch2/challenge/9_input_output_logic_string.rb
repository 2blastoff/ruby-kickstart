# Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever
# you type in), she should respond with HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless
# you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you
# (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! 
# You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.

# Hint: Don't forget about chomp! "BYE\n" is not the same as "BYE"
# (check the String cheatsheet if you need)
